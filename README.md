# Blockchain Breeding Grounds: Asia’s advance over the USA and Europe
This project contains the data and code used in the paper:
Denter, N. M. (2021). Blockchain breeding grounds: Asia's advance over the USA and Europe. World Patent Information. doi:10.1016/j.wpi.2021.102082.

To reproduce the results, first, you need to download all files in the PATSTAT_input_data folder.

Then, the code must be executed in ascending order of the sequence number.

The code "01_Descriptive_Statistics.py" creates an Excel sheet containing statistics about total Blockchain patent applications, Blockchain priority patent applications, Blockchain PCT priority patent applications, Blockchain non-PCT priority patent applications and Blockchain non-priority patent applications. Furthermore, the code creates a chart about the top 3 patent authorities selected by total Blockchain patent applications. The chart shows the trend in the above-mentioned patent application types per authority.

The code "02_Blockchain_Breeding_Grounds.py" creates two charts. The first chart contains the National Breeding Grounds index in an unweighted and weighted variant for the top 10 patent authorities of each variant. The second chart contains the International Breeding Grounds index as well in an unweighted and weighted variant for the top 10 patent authorities of each variant.

Please see the paper for further information.
